# ACM-Check-In-System
Re-write of the ACM Check In System in Java using the Magtek Card Scanner.

To run this application, download latest release on Github. Ideally, as it is written in Java, it should work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, however, the system has only been tested on Mac. 

Please check ACM Officer Wiki (under Webmaster) to determine network settings and other check-in system protocols.
